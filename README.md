## What you’ll build
We’ll build a small application which will:

* Authenticate the user using the Arkane Connect authentication provider
* Fetch a list of the user’s wallets
* Enable the user to manage his wallets connected to our application
* Fetch the token balances of the selected wallet
* Execute a transaction, from the selected wallet to a specified address

You can find the complete guide [here](https://docs.arkane.network/pages/js-multi-chain-wallet.html)
